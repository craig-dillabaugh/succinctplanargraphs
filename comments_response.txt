COMMENTS FOR THE AUTHOR:

Reviewer #1: The paper describes a succinct representation of a planar graph 
with bounded degree that supports I/O-efficient traversal of paths. Given a 
bounded-degree planar graph with N vertices, each associated with a key of q = 
O(log N) bits, the representation takes Nq + o(Nq) + O(N) bits and supports 
traversing a path of length K in O(K/ \log B) time, where B is the block size in 
the I/O model. The paper then describes an application of this result by 
describing how to represent a terrain, given as a triangular irregular network, 
that supports path traversals on the terrain I/O-efficiently. It also describes 
how this terrain representation can be used to support queries, such as 
reporting terrain profiles, trickle paths and connected components, efficiently.
The paper combines a few different earlier results on planar graph 
representations, and uses some of the standard techniques from succinct data 
structures to obtain the results, although it seems to require a considerable 
amount of effort to make the things work. The main result as such seems a bit 
restrictive as it only applies to planar graphs with bounded (constant) degree. 
But the application of this result to the terrain representation seems to give a 
good motivation for this problem.
Overall, I think the paper can be accepted for publication.

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
0. The result for the planar graph representation is stated without the bounded 
degree restriction at some places (eg., Section 1.2, Item 1). This should be 
fixed.

Author Response:
We fixed the specified reference (Section 1.2, Item 1 on p.3) and fixed a 
second reference on p.5 (last sentence before section 3.1).  There were the 
only such references we found in our search.



+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
1. P1 L44-45: ".. as more data can be swapped between memory and disk in a single 
I/O operation" -- more "useful" data?

Author Response:
We have changed this as requested.  See the final sentence of the first paragraph,
Section 1 on p.1.

+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
2. P7 L30: "concatenation of t bit vectors" -- t -> t+1

Author Response:
We have changed this as requested.  See p.7, fourth line of the paragraph with
the heading 'Identifying subregion boundary vertices.'


+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
3. P9 L42-45: it would make it less confusing to give a different name to the 
parameter {\bf B}. Also, the sentence "This ensures that every subregion fits in 
a disk block." doesn't make sense, as it's not clear what the value of {\bf B} 
is with respect ot the block size B.

Author Response:
After considering a number of possibilities, we selected a new symbol (lower-case
bold 'b') for the succinct block size parameter.  We also added a statement that
points the reader to the section in the paper where the value of the parameter is
calculated, and its relation to B.  In the current draft this change can be found
on page 9, first line of the second last paragraph on the page.



+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
4. P9 L56: Here and at several other places - the parentheses after rank (and 
select) do not "match"  (open parenthesis is bigger than the close)

Author Response:
We have found all instances where parentheses where mismatched that we could.  These
have been corrected sot that the open and close parentheses match. In each case we
simply removed the parentheses, as they were uncessary. The fixes appear at the 
following locations within our paper:
- p.9  last paragraph, 2nd line.
- p.10 2 paragraphs above Lemma 4, 2nd line.
- p.11 3rd paragraph (just above paragraph labeled \alpha-Neighbourhoods), 2nd and
       third lines.
- p.18 1st paragraph, 2nd line.

+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
5. P10 L14: \pi x -> \pi_x

Author Response:
This has been corrected.  See p.10, point #1 in the section labeled "Succcinct
encoding of \alpha-neighbourhoods".  

+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
6. P13 L24: later -> latter

Author Response:
This has been fixed.  See last sentence in the 1st paragraph in the proof to
Lemma 7 on p.13.

+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
7. P13 L55: ".. which represents a savings of .." -- represents is not the correct 
word here

Fixed: Section has been re-worded.

+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
8. P14 L11: store -> storing
Comment:  Fixed

+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
9. P14 L61: require -> required
Comment: Fixed.

+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
10. P15 L27-28: ".. lookup .. is O(1)" -> ".. lookup .. takes O(1) I/Os"
Comment: Fixed.

+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
11. P23 L42: "edge of t; " -> "edge of t, "
Comment:  Fixed. 

+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
12. P28 L5-6: the sentence could be rephrased to make it sound better


Changed: 
In this paper all faces are triangles, thus to find the entry edge
  at the triangle level is a constant-time operation using any
  selection technique.
=>
  In the case presented in this section, we are dealing with 
  triangular faces, so the entry edge can be found in constant time.

13. P29 L9: author's -> authors ?
Comment:  Fixed.
